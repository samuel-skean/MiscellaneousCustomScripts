Script files end in an appropriate, specific extension for their language - except when they are intended to be run interactively often, or to be run by some other tool or script, in which case they have no extension, to maximize flexibility in implementation.
Bash script files end in `.bash`, bucking convention - except for the convention of `/etc/bashrc.bash` on some Linux distributions (Debian, at least). This is partly justified by its specificity, but really justified by my say-so.

Supporting files are typically named entirely by convention (e.g. `.venv`).

This repo might grow to have some Swift code in it [by my doing :)]. Wish me luck!
